## Executive Summary ##


This document details the work performed and planned as part of Deliverable D4.3 / Task 4.3 "Data usage statistics and feedback".

**Status, June 2015:** At the current time this is an **interim report** detailing our goals and approach to ...
{TO DO: - Finish executive summary}

## Introduction ##

The DoW {TO DO: Link} for the Fusepool P3 project describes the main task of this deliverable as: 

*"T4.3 – Data usage statistics and feedback: tools to assess the usage value of open data and services based
on the automatic analysis of logging and auditing data [...] as well as user interfaces for directly posting feedbacks and requests ..."

The T4.3 task is then composed of two sub-tasks: gathering feedbacks from the users and analyse the services logs.

### Feedbacks ###

To let the end users give us feedbacks on the platform and the project, a feedback facility was added to the FP3 Community website (http://getfp3.com). The Jira issue regarding this task is found at https://fusepool.atlassian.net/browse/FPUSER-63 and was resolved around the end of March 2015.

It was wise to have a feedback facility in place at that time, as we have taken part to some public events where we've disseminated about the project - in particular the Spaghetti Open Data SOD2015 (http://www.spaghettiopendata.org/page/benvenut-sod15) where we've also ran a hackathon session to involve the community and to better share the knowledge about the Fusepool P3 platform.

During the SOD 2015 Hackathon we've also ran a challenge for creating applications using the data processed with the Fusepool P3 platform which has seen the partecipation of some groups of people and which ended up with the release of two applications. More information on this can be found on the Deliverable D4.2.



### Data usage statistics ###

To analyse the usage of our platform, and to offer a flexible and visual platform for that, we've used the Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana stack (ELK - https://www.elastic.co/products).
The ELK stack is based on three core components, each of which offers its services to the stack:

#### Elasticsearch #### 

Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Apache Lucene software, which provides a more useable and concise API, scalability, and operational tools on top of Lucene’s search implementation itself.
Apache Lucene is a robust, extremely popular and proven piece of software. Also Apache SOLR - another largely used and well-known search engine - uses it.
In the ELK stack Elasticsearch is used to store the logs and to quick retrieve them at visualization time

#### Logstash ####

Logstash is a data pipeline that helps process logs and other event data from a variety of systems, in the ELK stack it is used to process the data and send them to the Elasticsearch search engine. 
Logstash has several plugins to process various type of logs and to interact with different other softwares to which it can send the processed logs. In the ELK stack Logstash is used to send processed logs to Elasticsearch where they are indexed and, later on, retrieved

#### Kibana ####

Kibana is the third and last element of the ELK stack and works with Elasticsearch from which it retrieves the data. Kibana is the analytics and visualization tool of the ELK stack that lets you search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices.

#### Logstash forwarder #### 

A final piece of software is needed to make the whole system work, which takes the logs and hands them to the ELK stack. Such software is logstash forwarder, a linux daemon programmed to scan for changes on selected logs files and  configured to send all new lines to the Logstash in the ELK stack
