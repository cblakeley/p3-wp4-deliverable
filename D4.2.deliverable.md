## Executive Summary ##


This document details the work performed and planned as part of Deliverable D4.2 / Task 4.4 "Fusepool P3 demo apps".

**Status, June 2015:** At the current time this is an **interim report** detailing our goals and approach to ...
{TO DO: - Finish executive summary}

## Introduction ##

The DoW {TO DO: Link} for the Fusepool P3 project describes the main task of this deliverable as: 

*"T4.4 â€“ Fusepool P3 demo apps: development of at least two demo apps related to the tourism sector for
integration in web sites as widgets and as mobile, location-aware apps based on a rich set of open data provided
by the public bodies combined with data from the LOD cloud (e.g. Wikipedia/DBpedia)."

### Hackathon ###

At an early stage of the project it has been proposed to run a challenge within an hackathon where people from outside the project would be involved and instructed on the platform and the data it gather and requested to provide ideas for applications based on the data themselves.
To the winners of such a challenge some prizes would be given, to make it more interesting and add some motivation.
The project consortium agreed that this way we would either involve the external community, thus disseminate about the project, and have fresher views on the possibility our platform and its data could offer.

At the end of the first year of the project, we reached a state where the platform could actually be run, processing and transforming the data as well as serving them to third-party applications. We, then, started scouting for possible events where the challenge could be run, and the Spaghetti Open Data SOD 2015 (http://www.spaghettiopendata.org/page/benvenut-sod15) seemed the best choice. 

The focus of the Spaghetti Open Data community is, as the name says, the Open Data, so it's particuarly fitting our project, the Hackathon position in time was also perfect, since it was to be held at the end of March, as we figured by that time we'd have a stable platform and some nice data to be offered to the community. Also, since our data-providing partner (PAT and RET) are both from Italy, running the challenge in Bologna would let italian people working on them, which was a nice thing as most of the people attending the hackathon would, of course, have the historical and cultural knowledge that would help them in focusing on re-use our data.

So on the 28th of March 2015 we went to Bologna to take part to the SOD 2015, where most of the project partners were represented, and we ran a track at the Hackathon. The two days in Bologna saw about 150 people (here the list of people who sign up for those days http://www.spaghettiopendata.org/conf/iscritti), men and women from all over Italy and abroad, joining together for working on the several tracks set up. All the tracks were focused on the Open Data and their use.

The Fusepool P3 track, "Riuso di dati LOD ovvero Linked Open Data" http://www.spaghettiopendata.org/content/riuso-di-dati-lod-ovvero-linked-open-data-fusepool-p3-project, saw several people involved and we started by showing the platform, some applications built upon it, some tools we have developed (e.g. Uduvudu) and their possible applications. The people involed, then, gathered in some groups and started sketching out some ideas. During this process we were often asked for information on the tools, the data, the platform, and by the end of the day some ideas was starting to take form.

We ran the challenge giving two days to people for producing applications ideas and sending them back to us for evaluation. At that stage we were only interested in receiving ideas to be further developed if they were evaluated positively by us. By the end of March Sunday 30th, we received the proposals from the groups formed at the Hackathon as well as from other participants which couldn't attend the hackathon, but were able to work remotely.

Of the proposed ideas, we chose the two that were better structured and seemed more interesting, also considering the goal of the Fusepool P3 project.

### Demo applications ###

Out of proposed ideas from the SOD 2015 Hackathon two were chosen and have been further developed in the following months. 

The first one, a web-based application, is called "LOD events eXplorer" and by using {TODO: explicit the dataset used} some of the available dataset from the Provincia autonoma di Trento partner to form a timeline ... {TODO: short description of the app.} 

The second one, a mobile application, is called "In the Footsteps" and {TODO: short description of the app}.
